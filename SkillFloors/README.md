# SkillFloors -- NOT YET WORKING!
SkillFloors is (will be!) a Valheim Mod which creates a minimum skill level for each skill (the skill's "floor"). When you lose skill levels due to deaths, skill levels won't drop below their skill floors.

The skill floors start at level 0 and level up at 25% the rate of the skill's level.

This mod doesn't really work yet.

## Installation (manual)
Install with r2modman.

## Features
(i.e. what works!)
- Tracking skill floor levels and XP
- Save and Load skill floor levels between sessions

## ToDo
- Actually do its job and prevent skill levels from dropping below the floor on death
- - Show Skill Floors in the skill panel
